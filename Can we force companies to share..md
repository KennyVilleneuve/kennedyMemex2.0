A number of months ago Rodgers' phone services wnt down across the country, as a result the Goverment of Canada, through the CRTC imposed regulations that force companies to share bandwith in the event of emergencies.  Is it possible that we force companies to share infrastructure with one another as general rule, in a profit driven soceity, as opssoped to buidlign dozens of indepndant networks.
