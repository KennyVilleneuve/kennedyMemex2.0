Between 1992 and today communication and netoworks have changed alot, even more so compared to the days of the American Revulution and Canada's confederation. As Rowan point out here (Link to other memex) https://rowanegg.github.io/thememexofegg/Privacy.html privacy, even back then has always been paramount in communication, yet in the modern internet era it seems to be lacking,  to what extent can Goverments regulate the internet to ensure privacy? or wil Gooverment attempt to curtail internet privacy in the future in order to ensure somthing like national security?
