The United States' early domination of the internet does not come from some sort of unique American Exceptionalism, rather it comes from a place of fear. The Immense ammount of Government  funding for research etc only came about as a way to ensure that American Tech remaind ahead of the USSR's.  As such the prevelance of the internet today is to an extent owed not to the scientific genius of a few people. Rather it is owed to the fact that the Governemnt of the United States was scared, and pumped millions of dollars into its development. Dollars that could have gone elsewhere,  and leads to the question, would we better off if those dollars had gone elsewhere? Would the Internet still exsist in some altered state?
