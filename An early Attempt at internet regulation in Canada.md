Title: An early Attempt at internet regulation in Canada
type: literature

---

Miligan breifly intruduces us to the history of internet and cybercrime in Canada. Principally, the earliest legislation regulating the internet in Canada, passed by the Canadian Goverment, which is to say the *Communications Decency Act* (1996). The Act came about following widepsread outrage, and concern from parents regarding how easy it was for children to accses cyberporn. Befoore the passage of the law, there was no regulation on the Canadian internet, aside from Laissez-Faire capitalism. The act itself was largely inefective, but the mandate it gave the CRTC helped to create the framework that today allows the Goverment to tackle crime on the internet so much as it is possible.
