The debate in the Senate of Canada on  the Bill which seeks to promote Canadiancontent on the internet in a similar manner to TV and Radio, raised some important questions regarding how the law would effect Contentcreators and other actors in the internet arena, and how it would effect corparartions.  The bill also sought to prmomte and protect the French Language on the internet as evedienced by Senator Renn\u00e9 Cormier's remarks, about how peer countries like France had taken similar actions in their countriesl. As the Law grants increased powers to the CRTC and quite litteraly regulates the internet it is inherently intertwinded with the idea of internet regulation, as that is goal of the legislation, and the overarching question of the surrouding the debate. </li> <li>website/Important Terms/InternetRegulation  It's unlikley that Bush ever imagined that less than century after wrting about his idea of the memex Parlimentarians in Canada and dozens of other countries across the globe would be debating the regulation of a service that very much resembles his idea of a memex. Bush and his compatriats like Alan Turing 's work is the foundation upon which the moderen internet age is based, without their work its highly unlikely that society would be as rooted in technology as it is today, for better or for worse.  </li> <li>website/2-source_notes/bushWeMayThink1945sourcenote  The work of Bush and his collegues is ultimatly responsible for putting and end to the second world war (ww2), and the utter destrruction that it caused. Specfically when it comes too Bush, he workedon the project that would ultimatly lead to the creation of the two Nuclear-Bomb s that would fall onto Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki , putting an end to the second world war, starting the cold war and killed between 110,000 and 210,000 people in the process.  As such bush and all those who worked to proliferate nuclear wepons are to an extent responsible for the cold war, and the destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki but also the end of the second world war and possiblities created through nuclear energy. </li> <li>website/Idea Notes/Do we owe today to Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki?  To an extent we owe the modern Canadian experience to the destruction of Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki and the end of the second world war, there is no way that technology would be where it is today without the discoveries that came about thanks to Goverment funding during the second world, however the positive discoveries of that era where not the goal of the funding, rather they where the bi-product of the quest for destruction, albeit destruction in the name of the greater good. However after the war, the focus of Goverment funded research shifted from destruction in the name of the greater good, to a race to annihilation, between the NATO and the USSR. As such the Govermnet funded reasrch of that era led to countless  discoveries, but those discoveries only came about as a result of the quest for destruction, and dispite thier importance those discovieres are tainted as a result of the context of which they occured.  </li> <li>website/Important Terms/USSR After the second world war came to an end and the cold war began in earnest the Goverments of both the United States and the USSR pummped an inmesurable ammount of money into Space research, particulary into the race to determine which nation would land a man on the Moon first. Accordingly huge leaps where made in that race, with computers in particular being crucial. However these developments where not truley ultruwistic in nature, rather they came about to as the two states, in their quest to determine who was superior, fought one another through the game of propaganda. As evidenced by the fact that once the USSR began to put less emphisis on space, the United States follwoed suite.  Immense gains where made a result of the space race, yet the pace of those gains slowed to a crawl once the interests of the Goverment began to fall elsewhere. Should the Goverment have continued to fund reasearch into space travel, the world today would be a better place, even more so considering that reaserch could take place withoth being done under the ospus of the Cold war.  </li> <li>website/Important Terms/space race </li> </ul> <p>In tracing the connection between debate on Billc-11 and the space race, one thing is clear,  Goverment is responsible for the interenet's exsistence in the first place, thanks to its funding of the research that led to its creation in the first place. Morover it is also important to consider that, that reaserch has led to immesurable good in the world, yet it has also led to to immesuarable suffering. The answer to the question of  \"what is the most powerful thing that you have learned in this course?\" is a complex one. During the first day of class Dr. Graham mentioined how if one looks at railways in Europe today, and compares them to ancient Roman roads, they more or less line up. If both cases those netoworks where built by the Goverment.  In the context of the Internet, it was built up by the Goverment and it would not exsist without it. While the context of the construction of both the Internet, and Roman roads was not necessarily the most pious, the end result was a hummoungous positive. All in all the most powerful thing that I have learned in this course is that at the end of the day, unintended side effects of a stated goal can have immense positives, completely seperate from the stated goal, and that as result we ought to open Pandora's box so to speak, as dispite the fact that inside may lay negatives, there inside may also lay a total ammount of positives that catagorically outweigh the sum total of all negatives. </p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey%202/","title":"Final Journey 2","text":""},{"location":"Final%20Journey%202/#the-journey-between-websiteidea-notesinstitutionalized-misogyny-and-websiteimportant-termscrtc","title":"The Journey Between website/Idea Notes/Institutionalized misogyny. and website/Important Terms/CRTC","text":"<ul> <li>website/Idea Notes/Institutionalized misogyny.

These tropes have been merged with the discourse of neoliberal globalization since the 1980s, which emphasizes economic growth as central within the context of a global marketplace. The Canadian Government initiated comprehensive public consultations on the Canadian internet infrastructure in the early 1990s, led by the Information Highway Advisory Committee (IHAC). The IHAC's consultations resulted in two reports that proposed three major policy objectives: economic growth for Canada, preservation of national sovereignty and cultural identity, and access to the new technology. Internet policy-making has also been undertaken through other federal bodies, such as Industry Canada and the CRTC, the broadcasting and telecommunications regulator. In the early 2000s, the National Broadband Task Force (NBTF) continued this policy work, and the most recent consultative process, the Digital Economy Consultation, was completed in 2010 but has so far failed to produce any results. </p> <p>The author argues that internet policy-making in Canada builds upon historical regulatory processes, drawing from and reproducing both economic and cultural forms of state-sponsored nationalism.

The bill will give regulatory authority to the federal government over major carriers in all provinces, bringing uniformity to taxes, network connection, and competition. The bill also seeks to balance social policy goals and economic economy principles. Some potentially controversial provisions from the time include the power for the federal government to give policy directives to the CRTC and the requirement for carriers to be Canadian-owned and controlled. At the time many where  concerned that the bill concentrates too much power in the hands of the federal government, compromising the position of the CRTC as an independent body. The bill's passage at the time was uncertain as it ongoing constitutional talks and opposition from provinces like Quebec and Saskatchewan  ment that imopsing federal power on the provinces, at that time would be more trouble than it was worth.

However, clear policy conclusions on the effect of OA regulation were usually precluded by a fundamental lack in common understanding what actually defines an OA policy and along which dimensions of OA regulation can be structured. This paper attempts to reconcile these diverse views by offering a definition and a conceptual framework by which OA endeavors can be identified and uniquely classified. The framework encompasses, among others, mandated OA regulation of vertically integrated firms, public-sector participation, co-investments, and OA in the context of vertical separation. Along this framework, the extant economic literature is surveyed with regard to aspects of competition and social welfare, investment and innovation, as well as practical and legal issues. Based on these insights, a policy guideline is developed that shall assist policy makers in identifying the appropriate OA scenario for the regulation of telecommunications infrastructure. - Bibliography: Kr\u00e4mer, J and Schnurr, D. 2014 A unified framework for open access regulation of telecommunications infrastructure: Review of the economic literature and policy guidelines.

Does it mean that corparartions would be unable to patent software? The author and the European comission sought to find an answer to that question, however it remains ambiguous.

The paper acknowledges the significant role of the internet in modern society, highlighting the many benefits that online platforms provide, particualry their ability to democratic participation. However, it also recognizes that the internet can be a source of harm, and that there is a pressing need to address the proliferation of harmful content online and examines the ways in which this content is disseminated online. The paper notes that harmful content can have serious negative consequences, including social polarization, reduced trust in institutions, and harm to individual users. The paper argues that internet service providers and social media platforms in addressing harmful content. The author notes that while these platforms are not legally responsible for the content that users post, they ought to have a responsibility to moderate content that violates common moral principals, like violence, and that these platforms must cooperate with law enforcement when necessary. The paper suggests that internet platforms can take a range of approaches to addressing harmful content like using artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify problematic content. The paper also examines potential approaches for regulation and enforcement of harmful content, noteing that traditional regulatory approaches may not be effective in the online context, due to the global nature of the internet and the rapid pace of technological change. However, the paper suggests that a range of regulatory and legislative approaches may be appropriate, as opssed to pure Goverment regulation alone, The paper assertains that self-regulation combines with Government oversight, and direct Government intervention may be necessary and potentialy more effective. The paper emphasizes the need for collaboration between Government and Industry,stressing that they need to see each other as partners in order to effectively address harmful online content.</p>"},{"location":"departmentofcandianheritageTechnicalPaper2021sourcenote/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Put any links to separate notes you have teased out here.

However, the federal government was indifferent and not willing to foot the $3.5-million price tag. This was in 1971, \u00a0 by the end of the decade Bell Canada launched Datapac service, which allowed two computers to be connected, but it wasn't all that popular and the Canadian internet remained fairly dormant. In the 1980s, the idea of connecting Canadian universities was revived. John Demco began building a network on the West Coast, while a group of Ontario universities began a parallel project called OUnet, later renamed NetNorth, and expanded to include schools in Manitoba and Quebec. NetNorth was funded by IBM and was built mainly with the idea of sending messages, small files and not much else.

However, clear policy conclusions on the effect of OA regulation were usually precluded by a fundamental lack in common understanding what actually defines an OA policy and along which dimensions of OA regulation can be structured. This paper attempts to reconcile these diverse views by offering a definition and a conceptual framework by which OA endeavors can be identified and uniquely classified. The framework encompasses, among others, mandated OA regulation of vertically integrated firms, public-sector participation, co-investments, and OA in the context of vertical separation. Along this framework, the extant economic literature is surveyed with regard to aspects of competition and social welfare, investment and innovation, as well as practical and legal issues. Based on these insights, a policy guideline is developed that shall assist policy makers in identifying the appropriate OA scenario for the regulation of telecommunications infrastructure. - Bibliography: Kr\u00e4mer, J and Schnurr, D. 2014 A unified framework for open access regulation of telecommunications infrastructure: Review of the economic literature and policy guidelines.

The  Whirlwind computer was used to digitize radar data, which was then transmitted over telephone cables and analyzed in real-time by proto-computers. This led to the development of the Sage air defense system. The 1957 launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union resulted in the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),known today as Darpa with the extra D standing for \"defence\" which was tasked with ensuring that the Unitied states was not caught off guard by Soviet tech again, like it was with Sputnik. Over the next decade, ARPA developed a reputation for flexible, adaptive and open to technical ideas from all directions. With program managers on equal footing technichally speaking with those on the floor, as opossed to purely beaureaucrats. ARPA sought game-changing solutions to so called \"hard\" problems and left more simple genrla improvements to other organizations. The article goes over how the cold war lead to technological innovation in the US to combat the Soviet-Union and the lasting effetcs of (D)ARPA, which continues to be an important player in technological innovation in the United states today. </p>"},{"location":"lukasikWhyArpanetWassourcenote/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Put any links to separate notes you have teased out here.

Menke argues that the telephone was a powerful cultural symbol at the turn of the 19th century as it was the literal embodiemt of the futre coming into reality, and with it all the posisbility and anxcites that come with the future. In laymens terms Menke concludes that the telephone was the 19th century's cultural equalivient to the computer of the 20th century, as they where both the emobdiemnt of the future and the dawn of a new age. </p>"},{"location":"menkeMediumMediaFictions2013sourcenote/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>Fear of the Future.

Miligan found that there where two main arguments at the time, one by who he call the Techno-utopians, whose argument hinged on the belife that the Internet ought to regulate itslef, as technology was the key to socital progress. Within the catagory of techno-utopians where large corparations and elements of what would become the new right. On the other side of the fence where Canadians who where in favour of regulation, yet they where outnumberd, and ultimatly the internet in Canada would go on to remain fairly unregulated. Although at the same time as this was going the prsent day regulations came into effect with the main goal being to protect children. </p> <p>As in the era of the early internet the debate rages today as to weather or not regulation of the Internet is needed, escpially considering the fact that the internet of today is unimagible larger. Moreover the interent of today posses the ability to only harm indivduals, it can topple Goverments, as evdienced through the 2012 Montreal Student protests and the Arab spring.
