### Summary & Key Take Aways

*Here type up a 1-2 paragraph concise summary of the article. 

As the second World war drew to a close, one the key scientists on the Manahten progect, Vannevar Bush ponderd what the war had meant for science. He noted that the war generally thrown the avaerage scientist off their path of discovery, and onto one of destruction. As such the worlds scientists, having used their brains for years to wage war where now thurst back into peactime.  After years of focusing on war  would scientists simply go back to the ultruristic science of the past? This led bush to ask the question, what now was the scientific community to do? Bush points out the fact that we can infinitly extend the knowlege of hummanity, yet what is the point of having the knowlege if it is completly inaccsesible.  This leads to Bush's Idea of a Memex, a smart central document, able to to link to relevant information through a system of trails, allowing the ever increasing ammunt of information to located quickly. 

In the context of today Bush's memex is very similar to the internet or sites like wikipedia, where things are linked togtehr through hyper links making it very easy to go from one article to another to find relevant information.
