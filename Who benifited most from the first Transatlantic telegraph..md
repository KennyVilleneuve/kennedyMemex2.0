Müller argues that there needs to be more study into whose globalization was the first transatlantic telegraph. What Müeller means is that contempory reaserch has lawded the massive communications effects of the Transatalantic telegraph, however he argues more reaserch needs to be done into what it atually changed. This is because the tranatlantic telegraph mainly benifted the wealthy elite, and for the average perosn it chnaged very little, and globalized very little for them. Morover the cable promoted the contied segregation of classes and of genders, as it allowed the welathiest men to gain more infomration at a faster rate, yet for the average peron very little changed. Therfore the Globalization of the first transatlantic was the globalization of the wealthy elite, and not for everbody.
