> - **Abstract:** While we today take a largely free and unregulated Internet for granted, our present regulatory environment was established in the 1990s thanks in part to a fight around the role of children on the World Wide Web. Public pressure, coupled with a national debate around cyberporn, led to serious calls for its regulation under the prism of child protection. This article explores the tensions and early fights over whether individuals and families should regulate the Internet, or, as some strenuously argued, the government had a responsibility to impose regulation. Children were the focal point of these debates.

### Summary & Key Take Aways

*Here type up a 1-2 paragraph concise summary of the article. 

Miligan points to fact the in the early years of the Internet, when it was just becoming mainstream, there was debate on what was the best way in wich to protect children, without inhbiting them, making rhem fall behinf to children with accses to the internet in places such as Japan and the European Union. Miligan found that there where two main arguments at the time, one by who he call the Techno-utopians, whose argument hinged on the belife that the Internet ought to regulate itslef, as technology was the key to socital progress. Within the catagory of techno-utopians where large corparations and elements of what would become the new right. On the other side of the fence where Canadians who where in favour of regulation, yet they where outnumberd, and ultimatly the internet in Canada would go on to remain fairly unregulated. Although at the same time as this was going the prsent day regulations came into effect with the main goal being to protect children. 

As in the era of the early internet the debate rages today as to weather or not regulation of the Internet is needed, escpially considering the fact that the internet of today is unimagible larger. Moreover the interent of today posses the ability to only harm indivduals, it can topple Goverments, as evdienced through the 2012 Montreal Student protests and the Arab spring. Therefore the question faced by the Goverment's of the modern world is not weather the internet should be regulated, but how it should be regulated and to what extent.
