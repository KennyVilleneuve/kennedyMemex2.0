### Summary & Key Take Aways

*Here type up a 1-2 paragraph concise summary of the article. 

The author discusses how the launch of the Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon in 1949 spurred the US to develop an air defense early-warning network of radar stations. The  Whirlwind computer was used to digitize radar data, which was then transmitted over telephone cables and analyzed in real-time by proto-computers. This led to the development of the Sage air defense system. The 1957 launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union resulted in the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),known today as Darpa with the extra D standing for "defence" which was tasked with ensuring that the Unitied states was not caught off guard by Soviet tech again, like it was with Sputnik. Over the next decade, ARPA developed a reputation for flexible, adaptive and open to technical ideas from all directions. With program managers on equal footing technichally speaking with those on the floor, as opossed to purely beaureaucrats. ARPA sought game-changing solutions to so called "hard" problems and left more simple genrla improvements to other organizations. The article goes over how the cold war lead to technological innovation in the US to combat the Soviet-Union and the lasting effetcs of (D)ARPA, which continues to be an important player in technological innovation in the United states today.
