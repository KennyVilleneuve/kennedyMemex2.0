Oftentimes the very same infrastructures links we take for granted today are based upon centuries of infrasturcutre. As was pointed by Dr. Graham in the first class, for example ancient Roman roads being in the same places where the first telegraph lines where built in the Balkans. The case is similar in Africa, where modern day railroads and other infrastrucutre are contsuced neaby or upon old colonial progects. Therfore I beg the question, was the pain colonialsim worth it thanks to the infrastructure it brought? I say no because those people could have evntually built up their own infrastructure, moreover what the Europeans did build was not built for the purpose of helping people, rather it was built with the express goal of enriching the Colonizers at the expense of the local population.
