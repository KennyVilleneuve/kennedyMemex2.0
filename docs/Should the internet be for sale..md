projects::Should the internet be for sale?

The internet is more or less a nessicty to survive in the modern era. To apply for a job, get the news, do taxes, and an infinite number of other things the internet is required. Water, shelter and food are all basic needs and they are sold, how is the internet different? Water and electricity in Canada are provided by the Goverment, as a service, not for profit. As such why is there not a Goverment internet provider, that is much cheaper, or simply free?
