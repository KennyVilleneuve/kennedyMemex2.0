### Summary & Key Take Aways
The Canadian government in 1992 considred an overhaul to the country's telecommunication legislation with Bill C-62, semi similar to the modern bill c-11, as it \ seeks to replace the former exsiting framework and affirm federal jurisdiction over all telecommunication in Canada. The bill will give regulatory authority to the federal government over major carriers in all provinces, bringing uniformity to taxes, network connection, and competition. The bill also seeks to balance social policy goals and economic economy principles. Some potentially controversial provisions from the time include the power for the federal government to give policy directives to the CRTC and the requirement for carriers to be Canadian-owned and controlled. At the time many where  concerned that the bill concentrates too much power in the hands of the federal government, compromising the position of the CRTC as an independent body. The bill's passage at the time was uncertain as it ongoing constitutional talks and opposition from provinces like Quebec and Saskatchewan  ment that imopsing federal power on the provinces, at that time would be more trouble than it was worth. Escpailly considering that both provincies have vastly different telecommunications sectors than Canada proper, as In Quebec and Sakatchewan there are provincial crown corparations providing cellular services with Videotron and Sask-Tel Respectivley.
