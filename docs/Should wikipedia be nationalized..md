Part of Wikipedia's succses is that anyone can write on, and edit it. However there have been dozens of casses where false information has been uploaded to the site, therefore how do esure Wikipedia is correct. Allowing one country to determine what is and isn't right wouldn't be fair, however what could be done is throwing control of wikipedia to the United Nations, allowing the world's governing boody to determine what is true and what is not communilally. This would be in the best interest of all humanity as Wikipedia has effectivly become the modern library of alexandria, holding the majoroty of the wolrds knowledge.
