> - **Abstract:** While we today take a largely free and unregulated Internet for granted, our present regulatory environment was established in the 1990s thanks in part to a fight around the role of children on the World Wide Web. Public pressure, coupled with a national debate around cyberporn, led to serious calls for its regulation under the prism of child protection. This article explores the tensions and early fights over whether individuals and families should regulate the Internet, or, as some strenuously argued, the government had a responsibility to impose regulation. Children were the focal point of these debates.
