The article, written at the turn of the century, attempts to give a brief overview of the development of inter-networking in Canada at that point in time. Specifically the author goes over the idea held by computer scientists to create a Canadian version of Arpanet called canunet. Going back to the early 1970’s, and the Government's refusal to fund the project. The author then goes on to argue that this may cause the Canadian internet sector to move slower than others, until in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s the project of netnorth kicked into full gear, connecting all of the country's major universities and  kicking the internet sector into gear.
