Title: Infrastructure sharing as a form of open acces.

---


 The article presents a framework for regulating open access to telecommunications infrastructure, which is becoming increasingly important as more communication services move online. The authors review legislation and academia  and provide policy guidelines for implementing a unified regulatory framework. Kramer and Schnurr's idea for regurlations rests on four principles: non-discrimination, cost orientation, proportionality, and transparency. The authors argue that by implementing this framework it will promote competition and innovation in the telecommunications sector, leading to faster sppeds and lower prices overall.
