In the best interests of limiting cyber crime, would it not be more effective to enocurage internatiol co-operation through things like Interpoll, as the intertner easyly trancends borders? For exmaple large criminal busts like that of silk road (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpMP6Nh3FvU) need international co-operation anyways, why not start there as a rule of thumb?
