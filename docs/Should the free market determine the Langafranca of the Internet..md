projects: Should the free market determine the Langa franca of the Internet? 

The free market does not represent the best interests of people, rather it represents the best interests of the wealthy elite. As such why the compnaies like google and facbook decide what langauges to promote, they will promote enlglish simply because it is most profitible.  This means that other langauges are forced to fight harderd to be exposed on the internet, even if they have more native speakers.
