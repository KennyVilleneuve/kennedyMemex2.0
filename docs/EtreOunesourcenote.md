### Summary & Key Take Aways

*Here type up a 1-2 paragraph concise summary of the article. 

The Article methodlogically investigates the penitration of the French langauge on the Internet. Morover the Article seeks to investigte why while making up more than half of all content on the Internet non Enlglish has fairly low penitration rate. Meaning that while more and more French and on english content is uploaded how come it goes relaitly unviewed. The author's detemermination is that online publlishers like youtube and facebook systematically promote Englsih ahead of other lanaguages through their algorythim. The author compares this to he fact that 85% of Spotify's come from less than 1% of its catalouge, meaning that the alogrythm unfairly promotes those songs. 

The fact of the matter is that English is being given a leg up online, as such Govement must step in to help other languages prescence online as the free market is doing the exact opsite. This gives Creedance to the Canadian Goverment's recent Legislation in bill *c-11* wich among other things allows the CRTC to regulate online publishers. The research also helps to justify the invesment by the Govements of Canada and Quebec into international French media  through agencies like TV5Monde.
