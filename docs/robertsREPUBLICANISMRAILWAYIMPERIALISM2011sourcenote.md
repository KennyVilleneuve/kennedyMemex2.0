> - **Abstract:** This article questions accepted views of French expansion as a largely autonomous process, reflecting new attitudes towards Africa among policy-makers. It argues that the African railway schemes of 1879 were the outcome of an understanding between powerful railway interests and mainstream elements of the newly victorious republican parties. The ambitions of the railway companies were restricted in scope, however, being confined mainly to existing French possessions, while their sponsorship of imperial expansion was little more than a tactical expedient. It was only when the opportunities created for expansion were taken up by locally based pressure-groups or became caught up in international rivalries that empire began to take root in the Soudan and the Congo. By the time the anti-colonial reaction of the mid-1880s took hold, railway imperialism, a product of the short-lived economic boom, had already run its course. Government now had an opportunity and an incentive to put its imperial house in order. Nevertheless, the resulting equilibrium remained vulnerable to a re-emergence of the forces that had first set France on the road to empire in tropical Africa.

### Summary & Key Take Aways

The author exlpores the role that railroads played during the French colonisation of Africa, specifically the coloniastion of the French congo during the scramble for Africa. Moroever the author argues that the railroad served a key instrament in the newly democratic French Goverment's goal of "civilizing the African conetinent." Moreover Roberts conencts the constuction of the Railroad to the miliatry buildup in exsiting colonies, like Algeria, that allowed the French army to arrive en masse, with a well connnected supply network, thus allowing it to demolish all opsisiton to the French regime. 

The railroad played a key role in the French's ability to dominat their colonies as it alloed for the simple facilitation of transport of people, goods and importantly information. The train could allowed for much faster communications between Paris, and the colonies, making it much easier for the French Goverment to repress the exsisting popopulation in Africa, thanks to increasesing rapidtity that came about thanks to to railroads.
