-   Note taking tips,  If prof is repeating then what is going is important 
-   TÉXvn= ‘craft, Art 
-   Pronto-Indo-European teas meaning to weave and to fabricate.
-   Focus is put on the making of things, 
-   Computation is purely 20th century and is fairly irrelevant when it come to Networks, such of those of the past like ancient roman roads.
-   Jacquard Loom Punchcard invented in the 18th century,  enables the industrilization and replication individual weaving patterns.
-   History of digital and computation built on the back of women, despite the fact that women are rely the big main names mentioned in books.
-   The internet, and the parts that come with it, like energy consumption and minerals connect us physically to other parts of the world.
-   Theory is just a frame work for what we think is important in the world, and when we make that except it guides the kind of questions that we can ask.
-   Building a road collapses a space economy, example Ottawa art working from Orleans to Kanata collapses the space economy and recreates it as now the journey has been reduced and thus the economy around that journey evolves. 
-   Traffic jams are created by localized interactions of cars. Complex System
-   32 cent plastic ring cracks, challenger explodes, complicated system.
-   Complicated system are hard to recover from damage whereas complex systems are much easier to recover 
-   The internet is a complex system.
-   Assemblage theory, Things come together, things have a kind of agency and ability on their own. 
-   Example reading on paper and writing on paper involves friction and is therefore makes us go slower.
-   Perspectivism, The way record information matters,
-   Example race,  The way black and white people have been recorded in Canada vs in china or in Russia or Namibia.
-   A networks start whenever there is a relationship between two or more entities, and then we can examine what flows between them such trade or power or love etc, to determine what kind of relationship it is. 
-   Networks always leave a physical trace in the world. 
-   Extrapolating that we can realize that complex phenomena can emerge
-   Networks provide the network for which computation can happen.
-   If you care what someone else thinks about then your personality is entangled someone else.
-   Example of time and space being the same thing
-   We drive forty kilometres but say that we have driven 30 minutes

-   Medium is the message, for example lasceaux caves, little dots on the roof where gestation periods of neolithic animals, the dots are the message and the medium.
-   Modern example mckenny and suitcliffe, mckenny’s bike lanes where the message of a walkable city,  but because Ottawa’s not walkable now the medium of car dominance took hold, think people driving to work to listing to hear how suitcliffe wants to build 8 lane super highways everywhere. 
-   Medium of writing and knowledge sharing are relative of how a community might build itself
-   Power of library’s —> Shown by crazy states banning gay books form libraries, as the liebrary is still an important of part if the modern world, and states do not want people straying form their own mainstream thoughts, a la nazi book burning. 
-   Moveable type around 1300 AD, allows for the writing medium to move forward as much faster pace as stuff does not have to be done by hand. 
-   Inspire/influences Gutenberg for his parting press, 
-   Extrapolating this allows for the protestant reformation. 
-   Anyone can be an author anyone can be a reader, 
-   ^— Parales the creation fat early Internet etc. 
-   Jump to Melville dohey a wasp from New England,  “my university has all these books, everyone else should be able to have them too. 
-   ^— Invents the Dewydeciaml system of organization, which categorizes the books of the world infinitely. 
-   Robber barrons, build libraries to improve their reputations as a result.

-   Other system emeerges at the same time comes from the us liebrary of congress. Core based on the Thomas Jefferson’s personal library.
-   Public stuff uses dewidecimal system, private and research and education tend to use library of congress system. 

-   Introduction of the memex, 

-   A document that organizes itself, where a document leads to other documents, and these other documents know that the original document links to it.

  

**Jan 23rd 1:05 pm**

-   Cryptology,  systems for secret writing and cryptanalysis —> cryptanalisysis systems for revealing those secrets. 

-   Example in Dooley reading, the letters intercepted by George Washington

-   Letter is translated by a substitution cypher. 

-   Pattern of communications

-   A map of who is talking to who, exemplified by 18th century Boston.

-   We can see that these members of secret societies belong to multiple groups and thus ideas spread between the two and we can reasonably assume who is a revolutionary based on they talk, we can also find who is in charge by looking at who has the most connections.

-   Codes and cypher, you can have lots of complex ideas communicated in one word, for example in the army _operation overlord_.

-   Issues is that codes can only be used once and you have to know in advance what they mean. 
-   Enter the cypher, a system where messages can be communicated secretly as the only to know what the message means is to have the key, Koch shows what corresponds to what, think German Enigma machine.
-   Most common cypher is known as the ceaser shift cypher.  Write out the alphabet, and decide the number of letters that you will shift across.  For example q=t etc.
-   Fast forward to Muslim conquest of the Eastern Roman Empire, when roman works began to be transalted Into modern language, and they figure out how to defeat must simple roman cyphers, because languages have statistical properties. For Example you take the most common word in the cypher and that is most likely (THE) or you take the most common letter (E) and work from there) Figured out of the philosopher Al Kindi.

-   Early modern Europe and the Gutenberg printing press. 

-   People reading the bible and having your own thoughts is dangerous—> need for secret writing 

-   In 1623 Francis Bacon works out you represent the alphabet with just a&b so long as you do it in groups of five.  Semi Similar to early binary code (1s&0s)
-   Susceptible to frequency analysis, work around by using quirk of early parting presses by using different fonts and italics.

-   Nomenclatures

-   Mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks last until the late 19th century.

-   Fast forward to French Revolution

-   Semafour mechanized telagraphs, where messages can transmitted across distances by using code. ( men in stations, more advanced version of lighting the fires)

-   1849 message can be sent by electric wire instead via more code. 
-   Fast forward to today, ask the questions when reading the news etc, 

-   Where are the gaps 
-   Where are the women in this story 
-   Who/what is left out 
-   What other things had to have happened to support all this 
-   Always remember the breecht poem

-   Jacques de Vaucanson invents the archaic version on the punchcard while working for the king

-   Post Civil war America

-   Punchcards can be placed into machine to be tabulated thanks to electricity.

-   Creation of the Tabulating company to sell tabulating equipment to Government.

**Feb 1st 1:05 pm**

-   Electricity 

-   Can we store this stuff?

-   Enter Peter van Scary German name (Pete)
-   Tests his battery by getting his assistant to touch the battery and the assistant het a hell of a shock.

-   Hey, how fast does this stuff go.

-   Frenchman toilette, tests the speed by shocking one monk who are all touching in a sphere 1 mille across. 
-   They are all shocked at the same time. 

-   Ben Franklin

-   Demonstrates that lighting and electricity are the same thing.
-   You can direct lighting with lighting rods. 

-   Volta 

-   Metals and wet fabric piled and demonstrates that you’ve got electricity. 
-   Battery ^— 

-   Ørsted works out electric current can deflect a compass in a needle 
-   Faraday Works out you can use magnet to induce electricity.
-   Joseph Henry Inventor of many electrical devices including the relay.

-   Telegraphs!

-   Just before the 1830s,  with the arrival of the steam locomotive the modern telegraph comes about.
-   Transforming the communication systems of the world. 

-   Key words and phrases that may lead elsewhere (one or more articles)
