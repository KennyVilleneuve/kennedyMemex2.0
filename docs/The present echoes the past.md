The legislation in 1992 to regulate the internet creatas a framework upon wich modern day internet regulation in Canada can be built. The 1992 legislation ehoes the modern language in bill c-11 as it promotes things like increased federal powers and more powers being given to the CRTC. However this older legislation lack one key facet of the modern version, it is much less focused on language, particulary the protection of the French Language.
