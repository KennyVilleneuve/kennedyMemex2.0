### Summary & Key Take Aways

*Here type up a 1-2 paragraph concise summary of the article. 

Journalist Matthew Freeman discusses the early history of Canada's attempts to create a national computer network similar to the ARPANET, called Canunet, that would link together all of the nations major universities. However, the federal government was indifferent and not willing to foot the $3.5-million price tag. This was in 1971,   by the end of the decade Bell Canada launched Datapac service, which allowed two computers to be connected, but it wasn't all that popular and the Canadian internet remained fairly dormant. In the 1980s, the idea of connecting Canadian universities was revived. John Demco began building a network on the West Coast, while a group of Ontario universities began a parallel project called OUnet, later renamed NetNorth, and expanded to include schools in Manitoba and Quebec. NetNorth was funded by IBM and was built mainly with the idea of sending messages, small files and not much else. NetNorth, although primitive by today’s standards, was an important first step towards building Canada’s modern internet based society.
