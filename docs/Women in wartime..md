The British Goverment failed to understand the simple idea that men and women are fundamentally equal.  As such the British Goverment, which controlled the nations telegraph network, did not allow women to operate telegraphs even in the midst of the first world war. Eventually the need arose for people to operate the telegraph systems as the majority of working age, able bodied men where off at war, meaning that there was a pressing need for telegraph operators. Eventually the Goverment releneted, allowing women to operate telegraphs, but much later than in other industries like manufacturing.  The reasoing was that telegraphy was highly highly gendered, and the idea that women could operate telegraphs was simply unfathomable to the Britsh elite.
