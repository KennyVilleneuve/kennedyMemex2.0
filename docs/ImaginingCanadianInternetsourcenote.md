### Summary & Key Take Aways

The author argues that historically, Canadian policy-makers have used the tropes of national unity, national sovereignty, national culture, and national exceptionalism to frame and regulate communication technologies, a tradition that continues with the internet. These tropes have been merged with the discourse of neoliberal globalization since the 1980s, which emphasizes economic growth as central within the context of a global marketplace. The Canadian Government initiated comprehensive public consultations on the Canadian internet infrastructure in the early 1990s, led by the Information Highway Advisory Committee (IHAC). The IHAC's consultations resulted in two reports that proposed three major policy objectives: economic growth for Canada, preservation of national sovereignty and cultural identity, and access to the new technology. Internet policy-making has also been undertaken through other federal bodies, such as Industry Canada and the CRTC, the broadcasting and telecommunications regulator. In the early 2000s, the National Broadband Task Force (NBTF) continued this policy work, and the most recent consultative process, the Digital Economy Consultation, was completed in 2010 but has so far failed to produce any results. 

The author argues that internet policy-making in Canada builds upon historical regulatory processes, drawing from and reproducing both economic and cultural forms of state-sponsored nationalism. The offer notes Canada's unique left wing nationalism, explained here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yKzq3ueGr8, as part of the reason that Canada has  sought to push nationalsim in media and communications as part of the nations quintisental struggle to remain unique from the United states, and argues that Canada's nationalistic internet policy is thus a symptom of this struggle.
