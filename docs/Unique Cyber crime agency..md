A point within the research paper is the idea that there ought to be a seperate body from the RCMP, and CSIS that acts indepndantly, and is given its own unique mandate to pursue cyber crime, particualry child pornography. The paper argues that the agency ought to be an independant body within CSIS, in a simialr manner to the way in which the DEA is a indepdant body within the United States department of justice. Making this new bosy indepdant, would in the eyes of the paper, allow the new agency to put all its focus on cyber crime, as oppsed to the modern sustem where cyber crime is just another facet of the work of exsisting agencies like the RCMP.
