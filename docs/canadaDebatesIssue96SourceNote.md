In the debate, Senators voice their opnions on the topic, particulary when it comes to Canadian Content. Largely the debate comes down to the question of whether or not the positive effects of prioritizing Canadian content outweigh to poetential negatives, mainly the potenttial slipperly slope that this legislation could create.  This debate is exemplified by the Hon. Senator Pierre J Dalphond's Argument that The legislation will help promote French Language content Canada-wide, and increase the penitration of Languages other than English in Canada, and the Hon. Senator Ren√© Cormier's Argument that the legislation is a prime example of Goverment overeach into the day-to-day lives of Canadians. 

The debate around regulation of the Internet is one of the most pressing questions of our day and age, while total regulation may be impossibe, it is an important step the ensuring that the internet is a safe place for all.
