### Summary & Key Take Aways

*Here type up a 1-2 paragraph concise summary of the article. 

Bruton argues that the Birtish General Post Office (GPO) became one of the largest employers of women, in a very sexist time not as a result of equaility, but rather out of necessity. Before the First world war,  telegraph offices where highly gendered spaces, wherin the duties of opertaing the equipment where executed souly by men.  Howoever the need for  men to fight in the war created an acute problem for the GPO, without men to opertate the telegraphs, how would important messages be convyed. The soloution was ratehr obvious, allow women to operate the equipment, however due to the norms of the era, the GPO recived enourmous pushback on their proposal.  Eventually the British Admiralty acquiesced and women where allwoed to serve as telegraph operators, yet they recvied very little credit for the tremoundous impact they had on the war effort. Brutun argues that their needs to be more research into hwo women have been treted hisotrically by the communications sector, and that the women who helped win the first war thorugh their work as telegraph operators ought to recive more recognition.
