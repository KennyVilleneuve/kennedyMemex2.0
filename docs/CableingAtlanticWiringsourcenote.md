### Summary & Key Take Aways

*Here type up a 1-2 paragraph concise summary of the article. 

Müeller examines in this article the connection betwene the layinf of the first tansatlantic cable and globalization. However the focus of the author is not on globalization as a concept, rather the idea of whose globalization in the sense that, what partird have historcally benifited the most from the laying of that first Transaltantic cable.  Müller's focus centres around the idea that they laying of the first tranatlatic cable was benificial for the world, however it also served to benifit the mose intrenched instatutions, allowing them to get a leg up on others. Morover Müller also points out that there needs to be more reaserch done on how the first Tranatlantic cable affected groups other than wealthy, white men. Paricually Müller argues that more reaserch must be done when it comes to how the first transatlantic cable affected women, escpailly considering they where the ones who where oftentimes directing the communications, and actually delivering the telegrams.
