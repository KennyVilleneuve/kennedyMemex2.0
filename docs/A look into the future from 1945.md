Vannevar Bush postutaltes the idea of a memex, a device that in some way shapr or manner would allow for the interconnection of information in a simple manner making it infinilty easer for a person to have access to information. Moreover, the information that this perosn would have access to woullf be relaveant, as the document, the memex, would be a sort of smart paper. This means that within the memex relevant infomration would be highlighted, or somthing to that effect, and one could quickly go from article to another. This is very similar to today's wikipedia, as within articles, relevant information is linked and highlighted using hyperlinks.
