The modern Internet exists today as a result of the cold war a war that was waged under the ever present shadow of nuclear Armagendon and mutually assured destruction (MAD).  The shadow of MAD began to grow after the destruction of two cities, with nuclear bombs. As the Soviet Union and NATO increased their nuclear stockpiles, tehcnolgies like the internet where devloped to try and give one side a leg up on the other. Before the cold war, computing was limited to large machines, like Alan Turing's proto-Computer designed to crack the German Enigma code.  As such to do we owe the modern internet to the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Are we better off as a result of that destruction?
