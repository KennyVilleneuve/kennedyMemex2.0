> - **Abstract:** The concept of open access (OA) plays a central role in the ongoing academic and political debate on the appropriate regulatory framework for next-generation access networks in Europe. However, clear policy conclusions on the effect of OA regulation were usually precluded by a fundamental lack in common understanding what actually defines an OA policy and along which dimensions of OA regulation can be structured. This paper attempts to reconcile these diverse views by offering a definition and a conceptual framework by which OA endeavors can be identified and uniquely classified. The framework encompasses, among others, mandated OA regulation of vertically integrated firms, public-sector participation, co-investments, and OA in the context of vertical separation. Along this framework, the extant economic literature is surveyed with regard to aspects of competition and social welfare, investment and innovation, as well as practical and legal issues. Based on these insights, a policy guideline is developed that shall assist policy makers in identifying the appropriate OA scenario for the regulation of telecommunications infrastructure.

### Summary & Key Take Aways

The author examines the new regualtory framework for telecommunications, inclduing the internet and next level networks that was set forward by the european commession in twenty thirteen.  This new regulatory framework removes a number of regulations on telecommunications firms, with the goal being that Europe can catch up with the United-States and Asian Countries, partucularry South Korea, when it comes to the development of next-level networks.  Next-level networks are networks in which infomration can transimitted much quicker than by normal means. For example Fiber-optic cables would be next level networks.  

The article moves from a focus on the European comssion's regualtory changes to that of open access. The author examines the recomendadations made by the European comission regarding open access and points out that there is a lack of a real definition of what open access means. Does it mean that code can be seen by different people and worked on by others? Does it mean that competeing telecommunications firms could use each others bandwidth? Does it mean that corparartions would be unable to patent software? The author and the European comission sought to find an answer to that question, however it remains ambiguous.  The ulimate definiton was "In the open access network model, the roles of the service provider and the network owner are separated, and the service providers get access to network and the end customers on fair and non-discriminatory conditions." (Krämer & Schnurr, 2014 p.1162)  This definition as the author points out lack teeth as the European comission in the same legislative proceeding gave corparations the ability to work aorunf this definition by creating their own definitions of open access, which would apply souly to the corprartion and their networks.
