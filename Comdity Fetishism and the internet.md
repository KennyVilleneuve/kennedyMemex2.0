Title: Comdity Fetishism and the internet
type: literature

---


The internet is an essential in modern life, however like many essentials, like water and electricity, the internet is a comditiy that is bought and sold. As such there is a social relationship between the quility of ones internet connection, or the brand that one's internet comes from, and a person's social status. This is evedienced in Germany in the early days of the internet, as there where smaller, cheaper brands  created for local areas, however the stigma of having a internet provider that was seen as rural and cheap led to these cheaper brands loosing marketshare. The loss of marketshare allowed for  large companies to become the main  providers in Germany to emerge as the only real players in the Telecoms industry,creating an oligopoly thus making the internet more expensive for everyone.
