> - **Abstract:** Abstract Alexander Graham Bell introduced the electric telephone to Britain soon after its invention, yet it remained less than ubiquitous in Victorian daily life and literature. But in the 1890s, three fictional tales of young writers—Rudyard Kipling's “The Finest Story in the World” (1891), Ella Hepworth Dixon's The Story of a Modern Woman (1894), and George Paston's A Writer of Books (1898)—all invoke the telephone as they treat the obstacles to literary production. These texts highlight not the device's technical properties so much as its unexpected ability to embody an emerging concept: the idea of a media system that fused new communication technologies with print forms created for a mass audience—a version of what would later be called mass media.

### Summary & Key Take Aways

*Here type up a 1-2 paragraph concise summary of the article. 

Richard Menke explores in this 2013 article the socital implications of the implications of the rise of the telephone in the 1890's. In particulair he exmaines how the telephone was viewed in the popular culture of the era, through advertisements, newpapers and fictional stories, like detective stories. Menke comes to the conclusion that the Telephone is much more than a technologial revulution, it is also a societal one. 

Menke notes that many media representations of the Telephone saw them as not just a means of communications, rather they where a device that people could use to chnage the way they and others interacted with the worls around them.  Menke argues that the telephone was a powerful cultural symbol at the turn of the 19th century as it was the literal embodiemt of the futre coming into reality, and with it all the posisbility and anxcites that come with the future. In laymens terms Menke concludes that the telephone was the 19th century's cultural equalivient to the computer of the 20th century, as they where both the emobdiemnt of the future and the dawn of a new age.
